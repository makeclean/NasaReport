	abstract = {Geant4 is a toolkit for simulating the passage of particles through matter. It includes a complete range of functionality including tracking, geometry, physics models and hits. The physics processes offered cover a comprehensive range, including electromagnetic, hadronic and optical processes, a large set of long-lived particles, materials and elements, over a wide energy range starting, in some cases, from 250 {eV} and extending in others to the {TeV} energy range. It has been designed and constructed to expose the physics models utilised, to handle complex geometries, and to enable its easy adaptation for optimal use in different sets of applications. The toolkit is the result of a worldwide collaboration of physicists and software engineers. It has been created exploiting software engineering and object-oriented technology and implemented in the C++ programming language. It has been used in applications in particle physics, nuclear physics, accelerator design, space engineering and medical physics.},

	abstract = {Even though a computer-aided design ({CAD)-based} geometry can be directly implemented in Geant4 as polygon-mesh using the {G4TessellatedSolid} class, the computation speed becomes very slow, especially when the geometry is composed of a large number of facets. To address this problem, in the present study, a new Geant4 solid class, named {DagSolid}, was developed based on the direct accelerated geometry for the Monte Carlo ({DAGMC)} library which provides the ray-tracing acceleration algorithm functions. To develop the {DagSolid} class, the new solid class was derived from the {G4VSolid} class, and its ray-tracing functions were linked to the corresponding functions of the {DAGMC} library. The results of this study show that the use of the {DagSolid} class drastically improves the computation speed. The improvement was more significant when there were more facets, meaning that the {DagSolid} class can be used more effectively for complicated geometries with many facets than for simple geometries. The maximum difference of computation speed was 1562 and 680 times for Geantino and {ChargedGeantino}, respectively. For real particles (gammas, electrons, neutrons, and protons), the difference of computation speed was less significant, but still was within the range of 53–685 times depending on the type of beam particles simulated.},

At its current stage of development, Shift includes a parallel Monte Carlo capability for simulating eigenvalue and fixed-source multigroup transport problems. This paper focuses on recent efforts to verify Shift’s Monte Carlo component using the twodimensional and three-dimensional {C5G7} {NEA} benchmark problems. Comparisons were made between the benchmark eigenvalues and those output by the Shift code. In addition, mesh-based scalar flux tally results generated by Shift were compared to those obtained using {MCNP5} on an identical model and tally grid. The Shift-generated eigenvalues were within three standard deviations of the benchmark and {MCNP5-1.60} values in all cases. The flux tallies generated by Shift were found to be in very good agreement with those from {MCNP.}},
